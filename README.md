# PowerBall-jQuery

#DigitalCrafts Project: jQuery and Generating Random Numbers on Click


<b>Overall:</b>
- The projects focus was around the Powerball. This entailed generating 5 random numbers from 1-69 without any repeats, and a random powerball number 1-29. The primary goal was to first use JavaScript and printing the numbers to the DOM. After that, the code was used to practice jQuery by converting the exsisting code.



<b>Difficulties:</b>
- The whole project was definitly a process. First generating 5 random numbers and printing them to the DOM as this was the first lesson on this topic. Once that was complete, focusing on those 5 numbers to not repeat. And lastly to print the random PowerBall number. 
- The animation was difficult as well. This was the first time truly using JavaScript and jQuery this way.


<b>Goals:</b>
- It was incredibly fun to combine animation aspects of JavaScript, jQuery and CSS. My goal was to be unique and simulate PowerBalls rolling in and spinning each time they were triggered.
